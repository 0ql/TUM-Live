# TUM-Live

**Work in progress** of TUMs lecture streaming service

## Disclaimer

~ 95% of modern browsers are supported. IE is not and probably won't be (officially).
Reason being is that I want to avoid using jQuery because it's way too bloated. 
This is about what you can expect:

Browser | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | IE | Opera | Safari | Android Webview | Chrome Android | Firefox Android | Safari iOS | Samsung Internet
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
version | 42+ | 14+ | 39+ | no | 29+ | 10.1+ | 42+ | 42+ | 39+ | 29+ | 10.3+ | 4.0+
