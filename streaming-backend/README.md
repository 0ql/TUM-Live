# Streaming Backend

This instance of nginx takes a lecturers stream, authenticates it 
with the backend and passes it on to the LRZ where some more magic happens.

To use this, copy the example file to nginx.conf and substitute the password and 
host for lrz or other streaming services like twitch/youtube.
